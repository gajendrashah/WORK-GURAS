                            The common dilemma that the consumer at our Open House forum poses is what is the
                            right time
                            to buy? The ‘right’ time to buy your house is when you feel that you are ready for
                            the
                            responsibility that comes along with buying a house.
                            It is important to consider the objectives of buying a house. Ask yourself why you
                            want that
                            house? What really is the motivating factor when it comes to your decision to buy
                            that
                            house? Do you want to buy it because you want
                            to live in it with your family or do you look for an extra income that the house
                            will bring
                            in the form of rent? Or, are you simply buying it for long-term value leverage? The
                            more you
                            know about why you should buy a home,
                            the more focused your search will be and the better you will be able to select one
                            that
                            meets your requirements.</p>
                        <h3 class="head mt-3 py-2">What makes more sense - Rent or Buy?</h3>
                        <p class="parg py-2">
                            There is a simple way of judging whether to buy a property or whether you should
                            lease one
                            now. If you find a house that you would like to stay in, that is close to your
                            workplace or
                            easily accessible from there, then buy it. But
                            remember that the Equated Monthly Instalments (EMI) on your property should not be
                            over 40
                            per cent of your monthly salary. That way you would be comfortable paying it back.
                            You need
                            10-15 per cent of the cost as your personal
                            contribution to the purchase, as banks do not lend 100 per cent.</p>
                        <p> If you are paying a monthly rent that would constitute over 75 per cent of your EMI
                            please
                            think in terms of buying. (Check out the MB Buy Vs Sell Calculator which can serve
                            as a
                            broad indicator on whether you should lease or buy).</p>

                            There are many residential formats to choose from - Residential plot, apartments,
                            single
                            floors, independent houses and multi-storey flats. Given below is a representation

                            each type of property is represented city-wise on

                        <p class="parg py-2">
                            In Nepal, plots are much in demand. Even today most small cities are witnessing more
                            demand
                            for plots than for apartments. Multi-storey apartments are becoming the norm in
                            established
                            urban areas where cost of land and the convenience and security that
                            apartments offer have pushed demand from the younger generation. Also, as family
                            sizes
                            become smaller, many are selling large plotted developments in established city
                            areas for
                            smaller more compact apartments with centrally
                            managed facilities, normally in gated communities in the suburbs.</p>

                        <p class="parg py-2">Gated Community is a form of residential complex, sometimes
                            characterised by high walls and
