            <div class="qHeading">1. Is real estate a better investment as compared to the stock market?
            </div>
            <p>The real estate market is similar to the stock market, with its peaks and troughs always
                seeming
                to make perfect sense in retrospect. Also, both markets reflect the economy of the country
                and
                offer good investment opportunities. However, the risks must be understood along with the
                opportunities. Realty index will appreciate five times, but not the stock market.</p>
            <div class="qHeading secondQHeading">Investing in stocks: </div>
            <p>The profit margin inherent in stock investment has always been higher when compared to other
                asset classes. Stock market investments offer advantages such as liquidity and flexibility,
                which real estate does not. Stocks also offer growth rates that the real estate market can
                rarely match</p>
            <div class="qHeading secondQHeading">Investing in real estate: </div>
            <p>Home ownership is the most primary form of real estate investment. Unlike stocks, real estate
                is
                a tangible asset that provides for greater psychological comfort, security and satisfaction.
                Also, the return on investment for real estate is reasonably consistent because of the
                phenomenon of property appreciation. Stock markets are far less predictable.</p>

                years invest in real estate?</div>
            <p>At a young age, you can invest 300 per cent of your total assets by borrowing for your first
                house. Experts believe that your total monthly instalments should not exceed 30- 35 per cent
                of
                your gross monthly income. This is a good starting point and you should work towards
                reducing
                that number over a period of time.</p>

                that number over a period of time of the city, if it is from a good developer and fits your
                budget, but at the launch stage and when you exit, you get some value appreciation. That
                becomes
                your seed money. Most banks allow you to exit one loan and take another. So, you can sell
                off
                the smaller priced property in a peripheral location and use that as seed money to buy where
                you
                would like to stay. Else, you will always be behind the market in terms of finance.</p>

            <div class="qHeading">4. What is the best way for a first-time buyer to set a budget to purchase
                a
                home?</div>
            <p>Many new home buyers get excited and forget to consider the amount of cost they need to pay
                to
                acquire a home. Over-expectation from your income can put you in a financial stress. Your
                EMI
                should not be more that 30-40 per cent of your take-home salary. If the property markets in
                your
                city are very expensive and you cannot afford the property that you want to stay in, invest
                in
                whatever is affordable even in the periphery of the city, if it is from a good developer and
                fits your budget, but at the launch stage and when you exit, you get some value
                appreciation.

            <div class="qHeading">5. When is the stamp duty supposed to be paid?</div>
            <p>In general, there is Stamp Duty to be paid every time there is a transfer of ownership. It is
                calculated on the basis of the total value of your property. The amount to be paid varies
                from
                city to city.</p>

                home
                loan instalment per month?</div>
            <p>For calculating the monthly home loan instalment, consider your monthly family income - now
                and
                expected in the future. Family income includes yours as well as your parent's or spouse's
                income. Secondly, your family's current expenses, including all other loans you are
                servicing,
                are very important to be considered. Do not spend more than 50 per cent of the total income
                on a
                monthly EMI.</p>

            <p>Most often your own bank (e.g. where you have your salary account and most banking
                relationships)
                will give you the best interest rate. Also banks have preferred or invitation pricing and
                you
                can benefit from these special schemes.</p>

            <div class="qHeading">8. Can I enter into a sale agreement with any buyer without clearing the
                mortgage? What will be the modality of the transaction?</div>
            <p>Remember to value the said property which is mortgaged to a bank. In the first place, you
                will be
                required to clear the loan of the bank and then proceed to register the property in the name
                of
                the buyer. It is also possible that you, the new buyer, as well as the bank execute the
                agreement simultaneously.</p>
